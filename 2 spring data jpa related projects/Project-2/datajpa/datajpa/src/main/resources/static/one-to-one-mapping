We will take order and address entity to perform one-to-one mapping.

Each order has exactly 1 address and each address belongs to 1 order.

we use @oneToOne mapping annotation

order is source entity
address is target entity.


@OneToOne mapping can be unidirectional or bidirectional

In Unidirectional association, Source entity has a relationship field that refers to the target
entity and the source entity's table contains the foreign key.

In bidirectional association, each entity has a relationship field that refers to
each other and the target entity's table contains the foreign key.
The Source entity must use the mappedBy attribute to define the bidirectional one-to-one mapping.




UNIDIRECTIONAL   -> SRC TBL CONTAINS FOREIGN KEY
BIDIRECTIONAL -> TARGET ENTITY CONTAINS FOREIGN KEY  SRC ENTITY HAS TO USE MAPPEDBY ATTRIBUTE

UNIDIRECTIONAL: If we load order entity,then we can get associated  billing address  using unidirectional mapping  but vice versa is not possible



PRODUCT ENTITY AND PRODUCT REPOSITORY IS ALREADY AVAILABLE
