We will take Order and the OrderItem entities to perform One to Many mapping.
One Order has many OrderItem and many OrderItem belongs to one order.

In a Relational database system, a one-to-many association links two tables
based on a foreign key column so that the child table
record references the Primary Key of the parent table row.

UNIDIRECTIONAL:
its simple. it's just the parent-side that defines the relationship
we use only @OneToMany annotation


BIDIRECTIONAL:
we use @OneToMany and @ManyToOne annotations
Child entity should provide @ManyToOne annotation.


1 Order -> Many OrderItem
1 OrderItem -> 1 Product        btn orderItem and product , already there is onetoone Mapping.



1 2 MANY -> SRC TABLE PK IS CHILD TABLE FOREIGN KEY


DEFAULT FETCH TYPES:

ONETOMANY ->    LAZY
ONETOONE ->     EAGER
MANYTOONE ->    EAGER
MANYTOMANY ->   LAZY
